 | **Technical Knowledge** | Has a solid foundation in ML/NLP, including a working knowledge of older, non-neural approaches. Occassionally needs to consult resources for some fundamental concepts (e.g., MLE, PyTorch documentation, loss functions).|
 | **Technical Problem Solving** | Can diagnose and fix common issues regarding ML problems and concepts; however, needs assistance and direction when results aren't progressing for weeks. Often relies on mentors and other teammembers to help unblock. Needs some supervision to ensure the work is soundly executed.|
 | **Research Knowledge** | Has a limited understanding of the research literature; is familiar with a few seminal papers in the past ~3 years and popular tasks but lacks breadth, depth, and historical awareness.|
| **Research Abilities** | Is generally familiar with the process of conducting novel research but needs assistance in identifying problems and approaches. Often needs guidance in balancing time spent on reading papers, brainstorming novel research ideas, writing code, and running experiments. |
 | **Research Writing** | Has limited experience publishing papers (e.g., 1-2 first-author papers). Can write sections of a paper that concerns their work but needs assistance in crafting the narrative and phrasing the paper in the style of a strong research paper. | 
 | **Modeling/Coding** | Can comfortably write ML code in PyTorch and run sound experiments. Occassionally (once every 1-2 weeks) relies on others for help in debugging tricky code. Has limited ability in brainstorming and implementing novel architectures. |
